# XState model based tests with test-specific mock implementations for query functions

This repository demonstrates how test-specific mocks can be implemented based on the events generated by a model-based test, generated with @xstate/test.

In this specific setup we have an application that:

* is based around xstate state machines
* has an initial state name `initialising`
* moves from that state to `ready` as soon as the first data is received
* loads data using react-query

The approach for testing the application is:

* define a test machine
* define test events where the `DATA_RECEIVED` event receives multiple cases (i.e. multiple data returns)
* change the mock implementation of the query function (used by react-query) on every test path, based on the event extracted from the segment of the test model
* check in the tests if the returned data is displayed in the application as expected
